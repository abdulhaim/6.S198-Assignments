		   <p style = "font-size:20px ; line-height: 1.4em; color: #333 "> For this assignment, we were instructed to run some experiments with a partner and note down our observations. 

			   <br/> <i>Task 1: </i> We trained the network with a series of our facial expressions and observed that the network can tell the difference between the two faces with a confidence of greater than 95%. </p>

			   <br/> <i>Task 2:</i> I trained the network on various inanimate objects, including my phone, notebook, and water bottle and observed a confidence of minimum 95%. However as I take the object further away from the camera, it begins to misclassify. For example, the bottle is mistaken to be the phone at a confidence level of approximately 75% due to the similarity of color between the two objects. </p>

			   <br/><i>Task 3:</i> I trained the network on two different classes with the same image set; specifically my two classes were my face in a fixed facial expression. In this case, I observed the confidence shift between the two classes with each having approx 50%.

			   <br/><i>Task 4:</i> With the first class defined as myself two different people having Expression A and the second class defined as two people having Expression B, the classifier was able to distinguish between the two facial expressions at a confidence of 90% as well as the two faces.

			   <br/><i>Task 5:</i> With the first class defined as person A very close and the second class defined as person B very far, the network was very confused and would sometimes misclassify person A as person B and it could be argued that it was training based on distance. I also trained the network with a 3rd class of person B close to the camera, observing that the network could now identify faces with a confidence of 95%. 




			   <br/><i>Task 6:</i> Read the Russian tank parable (http://lesswrong.com/lw/7qz/machine_learning_and_unintended_consequences/). Create some examples that illustrate this phenomenon. Some of the face examples above may already illustrate this, but make other examples. 

With two different classes with two different people at different distances (Class 1: my partner's face close up, Class 2: my face far away), the network classifies based on the face (not distance) with a confidence level of ~80-90 percent. With an added class with a close up face of the one farther away (Class 3: my face close up), the network continues to identify faces and even starts to classify a single face based on distances, with higher confidence level (>98 percent).
Similar examples to the Russian tank parable are:
Class 1: Pink calculator in my room. Class 2: Black calculator in the classroom. Expected classification is the calculator, but the real classification is the background.
Class 1: Japanese characters in a book. Class 2: English alphabets on a smartphone. Expected classification is the different letters, but the real classification is the object.
