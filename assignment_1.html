		   <p style = "font-size:20px ; line-height: 1.4em; color: #333 "> For this assignment, we were instructed to run some experiments with a partner and note down our observations. 

			   <br> <i>Task 1: </i> We trained the network with a series of our facial expressions and observed that the network can tell the difference between the two faces with a confidence of greater than 95%. </p>

			   <br> <i>Task 2:</i> I trained the network on various inanimate objects, including my phone, notebook, and water bottle.  </p>

			   <br><i>Task 3:</i> Train two different classes with the same image set (for example, your face in a fixed expression).

			   <br><i>Task 4:</i> Train one class on two people with expression A and another class on two people with expression B. Does the network end up learning the difference between the two faces, or the difference between the two expressions? Or is it just confused (i.e., wrong, or not very confident)?

			   <br><i>Task 5:</i> Try a similar experiment, training class 1 as person A’s face close up and class 2 as person B’s face far away. Now move your faces closer/farther. How does the network behave? What happens to the network’s performance and confidence if you add a third class with person B’s face close up?


			   <br><i>Task 6:</i> Read the Russian tank parable (http://lesswrong.com/lw/7qz/machine_learning_and_unintended_consequences/). Create some examples that illustrate this phenomenon. Some of the face examples above may already illustrate this, but make other examples.
