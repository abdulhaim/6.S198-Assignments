		<h3> <b> Build Teachable Machine on Computer </b> </h3>

		<p> For this assignment, we were instructed to run some experiments with a partner and note down our observations!


			1. Train classes with images of your face and your partner’s face where you show different expressions. For example, the first class would be partner A’s face making all sorts of expressions and the second class would be partner B’s face making all sorts of expressions. Can the network tell the difference between the two faces? If so, how confident is it?  Note that the program will start training for a class with images from the camera when you press the corresponding button. It will keep training as long as the button is depressed.

			2. Try training on various inanimate objects or even photos on your phone that you hold up in front of the computer camera.

			3. Train two different classes with the same image set (for example, your face in a fixed expression).

			4. Train one class on two people with expression A and another class on two people with expression B. Does the network end up learning the difference between the two faces, or the difference between the two expressions? Or is it just confused (i.e., wrong, or not very confident)?

			5. Try a similar experiment, training class 1 as person A’s face close up and class 2 as person B’s face far away. Now move your faces closer/farther. How does the network behave? What happens to the network’s performance and confidence if you add a third class with person B’s face close up?

			6. Read the Russian tank parable (http://lesswrong.com/lw/7qz/machine_learning_and_unintended_consequences/). Create some examples that illustrate this phenomenon. Some of the face examples above may already illustrate this, but make other examples.
