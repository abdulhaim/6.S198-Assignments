		<h2> <b> Train Some Classes </b> </h2>

		   <p style = "font-size:20px ; line-height: 1.4em; color: #333 "> For this assignment, we were instructed to run some experiments with a partner and note down our observations. 

			   <br/> <i>Task 1: </i> We trained the network with a series of our facial expressions and observed that the network can tell the difference between the two faces with a confidence of greater than 95%.

			   <br/> <i>Task 2:</i> I trained the network on various inanimate objects, including my phone, notebook, and water bottle and observed a confidence of minimum 95%. However as I take the object further away from the camera, it begins to misclassify. For example, the bottle is mistaken to be the phone at a confidence level of approximately 75% due to the similarity of color between the two objects. </p>

			   <br/><i>Task 3:</i> I trained the network on two different classes with the same image set; specifically my two classes were my face in a fixed facial expression. In this case, I observed the confidence shift between the two classes with each having approx 50%.

			   <br/><i>Task 4:</i> With the first class defined as myself two different people having Expression A and the second class defined as two people having Expression B, the classifier was able to distinguish between the two facial expressions at a confidence of 90% as well as the two faces.

			   <br/><i>Task 5:</i> With the first class defined as person A very close and the second class defined as person B very far, the network was very confused and would sometimes misclassify person A as person B and it could be argued that it was training based on distance. I also trained the network with a 3rd class of person B close to the camera, observing that the network could now identify faces with a confidence of 95%. 

			   <br/><i>Task 6:</i> The Russian Tank Parable <a href = "http://lesswrong.com/lw/7qz/machine_learning_and_unintended_consequences/"> is used to illustrate when a network learns based on a different feature in the image rather than the one you assume - in this scenario, the images were trained on the classes cloudy/sunny rather than trees/camouflaged tanks. 
			   <br/>
			   Some examples to illustrate this include:
			   <br/>
			   Example #1: First class defined as a pencil, Second Class defined as a pen. The intended classification is the object but the real classification could be the background of the object (kitchen versus classroom)
