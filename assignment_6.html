			<b> Problem 1: What is the reward scheme for FrozenLake? 	</b>

			<br/> <br/>

			The states are: {S, F, H, G} representing starting point, frozen surface, hole, and goal, giving the reward scheme:

			<br/> <br/>

			R(s,a) = 1  if s = G
						<br/> <br/>
			&nbsp  = 0  otherwise 
						<br/> <br/>

			<br/> <br/>


			<b> Problem 2: How big is the table used for Q-learning above? </b>

			<br/> <br/>

			To learn the long-term expected rewards, we use Q-learning, which learns the value for taking a particular action within a given state. Since the table is storing the values of every action made from every state, ane we have 4 actions (up, down, left, right) and 4 states (starting point, frozen surface, hole, and goal), we get a transition function or table for each action. Each transition function table is 16 values (4 by 4), and so we get a total of 16*4 = 64 values in your table.

			<br/> <br/>

			<b> Problem 3: Did the rewards improve over time? Why or why not? </b>

			<br/> <br/>

			The rewards did not improve over time and the totalReward is zero at every step in the while loop. 

			<br/> <br/>

			<b> Problem 4: In the above code segment, we provided some values for the learning rate and discount factor. Try different values for the learning rate. What do you observe?</b>

			<br/> <br/>

			For instance, decreasing the discount factor decreases the amount of time it takes for the program to finish and coverge to find a final solution.
